# demo-equality #

Demos for type-safe equality with Scala implicits.

The simplest approach gives you a **type-safe** yet **unbalanced** `===` equality operation:

```
scala> import name.heikoseeberger.demoequality._
import name.heikoseeberger.demoequality._

scala> import SimpleEquality._
import SimpleEquality._

scala> 123 === 666
res0: Boolean = false

scala> "a" === "a"
res1: Boolean = true

scala> 123 === "a"
<console>:14: error: type mismatch;
 found   : String("a")
 required: Int
              123 === "a"

scala> Seq(1, 2, 3) === List(1, 2, 3)
res3: Boolean = true

scala> List(1, 2, 3) === Seq(1, 2, 3)
<console>:17: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Seq[Int]
 required: List[Int]
              List(1, 2, 3) === Seq(1, 2, 3)
```
