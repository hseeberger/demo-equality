 * By importing `TypeWiseBalancedEquality._` you get '''type-safe''' and '''type-wise balanced''' equality:

 *
 * 123 === 666 // false
 * "a" === "a" // true
 * 123 === "a" // won't compile!
 * }}}
 *
 * This equality is balanced with respect to subtyping,
 * hence `===` works (compiles) for any two arguments on the left and right,
 * whose types are in a subtype relationship (which includes type equality):
 *
 * {{{
 * Seq(1, 2, 3) === List(1, 2, 3)
 * List(1, 2, 3) === Seq(1, 2, 3)
 * }}}
 *
 * Yet it doesn't work (compile) for two arguments on the left and right,
 * whose types are in an implicit conversion relationship:
 *
 * {{{
 * 1L === 1 // won't compile!
 * 1 === 1L // won't compile!
 * }}}
