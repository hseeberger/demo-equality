 * By importing `ViewWiseBalancedEquality._` you get '''type-safe''' and '''view-wise balanced''' equality:

 *
 * 123 === 666 // false
 * "a" === "a" // true
 * 123 === "a" // won't compile!
 * }}}
 *
 * This equality is balanced with respect to implicit conversions,
 * hence `===` works (compiles) for any two arguments on the left and right,
 * whose types are in a implicit conversion relationship (which includes a subtype relationship),
 * i.e. one can be viewed as the other:
 *
 * {{{
 * Seq(1, 2, 3) === List(1, 2, 3)
 * List(1, 2, 3) === Seq(1, 2, 3)
 * 1L === 1
 * 1 === 1L
 * }}}
